Notable differences in AWS SDK v2 include, but may not be limited to: AWS SDK v2 requires users to specify the region to use for signing requests, or else to run in an environment in which it can determine the correct region automatically. The older SDK used to determine the region based on the endpoint URL as specified with the s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.endpoint setting, together with other data drawn from the operating environment, and fell back to us-east-1 if no better value was found. AWS SDK v2 does not support the EC2 IMDSv1 protocol. AWS SDK v2 does not support the com.amazonaws.sdk.ec2MetadataServiceEndpointOverride system property. AWS SDK v2 does not permit specifying a choice between HTTP and HTTPS so the s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.protocol setting is deprecated and no longer has any effect. AWS SDK v2 does not permit control over throttling for retries, so the s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.use_throttle_retries setting is deprecated and no longer has any effect. AWS SDK v2 requires the use of the V4 signature algorithm, therefore, the s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.signer_override setting is deprecated and no longer has any effect. AWS SDK v2 does not support the log-delivery-write canned ACL. AWS SDK v2 counts 4xx responses differently in its metrics reporting. AWS SDK v2 always uses the regional STS endpoint, whereas AWS SDK v2 could use either a regional endpoint or the global https://sts.amazonaws.com one.

This includes, but may not be limited to, the following items: Specify the correct signing region using the s3.client.${CLIENT_NAME}.region setting on each node. {es} will try to determine the correct region based on the endpoint URL and other data drawn from the operating environment, but might not do so correctly in all cases.
