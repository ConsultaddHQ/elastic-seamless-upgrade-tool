# User Management

The Seamless Upgrade Tool includes a built-in CLI for managing users inside the container.  
This guide covers how to create, list, remove, and reset passwords for user accounts.

---

## Why use this CLI?

- There is **no public signup UI** for the tool.
- User management is restricted to trusted administrators.
- The CLI must be run from **inside the container** with host-level access.

---

## Prerequisites

- The Seamless Upgrade Tool container is running.
- You have Docker or Podman access to the host machine.

Check running containers:

```bash
docker ps
# or
podman ps
````

Expected output:

```
CONTAINER ID   NAME                   STATUS
1234abcd5678   seamless-upgrade-tool  Up 5 minutes
```

---

## Command Overview

Supported commands:

| Command          | Description             |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- |
| `create`         | Create a new user       |
| `list`           | List all existing users |
