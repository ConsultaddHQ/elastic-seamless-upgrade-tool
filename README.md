# Seamless Upgrade Tool

## Overview

The **Seamless Upgrade Tool** is a containerized **Node.js + React** application designed to facilitate **seamless upgrades of on-premise Elasticsearch clusters**. It provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring cluster status, triggering upgrades, and tracking real-time progress.

### Key Features

-   **Cluster Overview**: Displays **node count, health status, shard information**, and more.
-   **Upgrade Management**: Users can **trigger node upgrades** with a single click.
-   **Real-Time Monitoring**: Progress tracking and status updates during the upgrade process.
-   **Ansible Integration**: Uses **Ansible playbooks** to perform upgrades efficiently.
-   **Failure Handling**: Automatic **rollback playbook** (coming soon) for failed upgrades.

---

## Use Cases

-   **Seamless version upgrades** of on-premise **Elasticsearch clusters**.
-   **Cluster health monitoring** before and after the upgrade.
-   **Automated node upgrade management** with minimal downtime.

---

## Get Started

The way to set up the Seamless Upgrade Tool is by using **Start Script**.

### Prerequisites

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed on your machine.
-   Elasticsearch cluster accessible with **SSH credentials**.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConsultaddHQ/elastic-seamless-upgrade-tool/main/start.sh | sh
```

#### Run a specific version:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ConsultaddHQ/elastic-seamless-upgrade-tool/main/start.sh | sh -s -- v0.0.1
```

3. After validating the snapshot condition there will

4. After the step is completed then you can view the deprecated settings which you need to resolve , you cant proceed without resolving all the critical deprecated settings for both elastic-search and kibana

5. Once second step is completed you can go to the node-upgrade page

### 4. Elasticsearch Node upgradation

1. You can view all the nodes and there state here at this page

    ![node details](https://i.postimg.cc/x81Bx4pm/Screenshot-2025-03-06-at-6-46-12-PM.png)

2. And can trigger the update of nodes one by one note that you need to follow the order
   first data then master eligible then master nodes to know why [click here](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.17/rolling-upgrades.html)

### 5. Kibana Upgradation

1. After upgrading elasticsearch you can go to upgrade assist page again and now you can see the option to upgrade kibana enabled
